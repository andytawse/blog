There's no flatpak for my version but there is a <code>.deb</code> file. There were a load of <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=609126">dependency problems like this</a> when trying to install this in the normal way. The discussion on that thread led me to try to avoid installing those dependencies to keep things clean.</p><p>I unpacked the <code>.deb</code> which gives me all the files, basically ready to use, and let GNOME know about it so I can easily launch it.</p><h2>Unpack</h2><p>Use this command with your <code>.deb</code> filename and preferred destination directory.</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext">dpkg-deb -R bitwig-studio-4.1.6.deb destination</code></pre><h2>Fix a different dependency</h2><p>The file you need to run inside the deb archive is <code>opt/bitwig-studio/bitwig-studio</code>. Clicking on it didn't do anything. Running it from a terminal gave this error:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext">libx11-windowing-system.so: libxcb-ewmh.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code></pre><p>That can be fixed by installing the library in question:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt install libxcb-ewmh2</code></pre><p>Bitwig will now run, but with a generic icon in the dock, and won't appear in the applications menu (when I press the meta (Windows) key).</p><h2>Telling the OS about the application</h2><p>We need a file at <code>/usr/share/applications/bitwig.desktop</code>. This is what I've got:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext">[Desktop Entry]
Name=Bitwig
Exec=/home/andy/Applications/bitwig/opt/bitwig-studio/bitwig-studio
Type=Application
Icon=/home/andy/Applications/bitwig/opt/bitwig-studio/resources/icons/application/bitwig.svg</code></pre><p>It was immediately recognised. Hitting the meta key, I can search for Bitwig, and I can pin it to the dock by right clicking the icon while it's showing in the application menu</p><p>Bitwig runs well so far. Pipewire is the default on Ubuntu 24 and with tools like <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.dimtpap.coppwr">coppwr</a> you can see it's there and doing something involving Bitwig. I've got Bitwig using JACK and while I haven't been taxing the system, it's working well, and other applications can simultaneously play audio (something that I've had problems with in the past). I had crashes and other hassles when I upgraded to Pipewire on my Ubuntu 20 system - I can test if it's safe to upgrade now. I'm only using the built-in audio on an old Thinkpad while I travel. I'll test with my USB audio interface when I'm home.</p><h4>Sidenote</h4><p>After seeing the error from <code>libx11-windowing-system</code> I started wondering about x11 and Wayland. The library is <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/libxcb-ewmh2">related to a core X library</a>. I'm on Wayland, as it's the default on Ubuntu 24 and I haven't messed about with it. Maybe Bitwig doesn't support Wayland and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland#Xwayland">XWayland</a> is being run to bridge the two? Running <code>xlsclients -l</code> shows me that it's not, even though it's installed (<code>apt search xwayland</code>). That's a mystery for now.</p></div><div class="tags"><div><a href="/taxonomy/term/17" hreflang="en">Ubuntu</a></div><div><a href="/taxonomy/term/16" hreflang="en">Bitwig</a></div></div></div></article></div></div> </main></div></div></body></html>
